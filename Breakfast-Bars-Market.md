Brands are expected to adopt more sustainable packaging and source ingredients responsibly.</li>  <li><strong>Personalized Nutrition:</strong> With advancements in nutritional science, consumers are seeking more personalized products tailored to their unique dietary needs. Functional ingredients, such as adaptogens and nootropics, will become more common in breakfast bars.</li>  <li><strong>Post-Pandemic Shifts:</strong> The post-pandemic world has led to more remote work and hybrid lifestyles.
